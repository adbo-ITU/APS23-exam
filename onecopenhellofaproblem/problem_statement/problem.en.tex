This year, the annual metal festival Copenhell will be closed by the band \textit{Algorithmic Power Symphony}, that consists solely of student from the nearby IT University. The concert is a huge success, which has resulted in a huge problem for all the band members!

The plan was for all of them to attend their final exam in the course "Heavy Metalgorithmic Problem Solving" after ending their concert, but due to the huge demand for encores, they are now running late. The only way for them to reach their exam in time is for them to take advantage of the crowd in front of them and crowdsurf all the way from the stage and to the back of the crowd. Since it is the end of a long festival, all the crowd-members have pretty tired arms from lifting beers and throwing devil-horns, meaning that they can only help lift at most one band member.

How many band members will miss their exams, due to not being able to crowdsurf safely all the way to the back of the crowd?

Once a crowd member receives a band member, they can pass the band member to any of their 8 adjacent crowd members (that is, both orthogonally and diagonally adjacent).

\section*{Input}

\begin{verbatim}
4 9 3
.###..#.#
..#..##.#
#....##.#
..#...##.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
  \item First line contains three numbers: $r$, $c$, $b$
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $r$: the number of rows
      \item $c$: the number of columns
      \item $b$: the number of band members
    \end{itemize}
  \item Then follow $r$ lines with $c$ characters. Each character indicates whether a person is standing there (\texttt{\#}) or if nobody is there to carry (\texttt{.}). The first row shows the people closest to the scene, and the last row shows the people furthest from the scene.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output}

The number of band members not able to crowdsurf. I.e. how many band members remain standing on the stage.

Expected output for above input is 1. Two band members can surf the two rightmost paths. The remaining band member has nowhere to surf.
